What is the difference between visibility:hidden and display:none ?
Last Updated : 25 Jun, 2020
Both of the property is quite useful in CSS. The visibility: “hidden”; property is used to specify whether an element is visible 
or not in a web document but the hidden elements take up space in the web document. The visibility is a property in CSS that 
specifies the visibility behavior of an element and display: “none” property is used to specify whether an element is exist 
or not on the website.

Syntax:

Visibility property:
visibility: visible| hidden | collapse | initial | inherit;

Display property:
display: none |  inline | block | inline-block;

So, the difference between display: “none”; and visibility: “hidden”;, right from the name itself we can tell the difference as 
display: “none”;, completely gets rids of the tag, as it had never exists in the HTML page whereas visibility: “hidden”;, 
just makes the tag invisible it will still be on the HTML page occupying space it’s just invisible.

CSS display: none; CSS visibility: hidden;

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <head>
      <style>
         h3 {
            display: none;
         }
         h2 {
            visibility: hidden;
         }
      </style>
   </head>
   <body>
      <h2>This heading is visible</h2>
      <h3>This is a hidden heading</h3>
      <p>The hidden heading does not take up space even after hiding it since we have used display: none;.</p>
   </body>
</html>
